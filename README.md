DevCollab - A platform to encourage Team Work

Platform for:
1. Training
2. Educational purposes
3. Self-improvement

A beginner self taught programmer has got a dilemma of initiating himself into the unknown 
of working with other people. When is the right time? What to expect?

Unfortunately, there's only one way to learn these skills and it's to get yourself involved into the nitty-gritty. 

One solution is to get yourself surrounded by people who shares same passion at DevCollab platform. 

To start simply register, login, join a team and get yourself engulfed in awesomeness.

We can promise a good time, learning experience (also some good-ol' hard work, stress, sweat and tears to make you 
stronger!).
